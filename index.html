            <h1>OpenJourney: Midjourney, but <em>open source...!</em></h1>
            <p>
                OpenJourney is a <em>Text-to-Image</em> AI model which has the goal of bringing an open source equivalent to <a href="https://midjourney.com">Midjourney</a> to the people. It is currently based on <a href="https://huggingface.co/prompthero/midjourney-v4-diffusion">prompthero/midjourney-v4-diffusion</a>
                and is under further developments by <a href="https://haghiri75.com/en">Muhammadreza Haghiri</a> to get closer results to Midjourney AI. 
            </p>
            <p>
                OpenJourney is trying to make AI art more accessible and affordable for people who enjoy making their ideas to great pieces of art and we try to make you, the creator of the art, the actual owner of the generated art. 
            </p>
            <h2>Why OpenJourney?</h2>
            <p>
                First of all, as long as you have a computer (specially a computer with a GPU which has CUDA support) you are able to generate awesome art on your own. Second, for selling your generated art, you have to <em>pay</em> the platform you have used to create the art.
            </p>
            <p>
                The main thought behind <em>OpenJourney</em> is that you <strong>must</strong> have all the control on the tool and also generated material. You must be able to run it wherever you want, you must be able to generate whatever you want and also you must be able to sell your generated art in any form you like!
            </p>
            <h2>Sample Generated Art</h2>

            <h2>Who can use OpenJourney</h2>
            <p>Short answer : everyone!</p>
            <p>Long answer on the other hand is <em>everyone who has artistic tendencies or ideas, but cant implement them as they wish.</em> Let's make it a little bit more clear. For example, you had a dream about a calm sea, and saw an ancient battleship seeking the shore. You can make it to an artistic painting and keep it in your digital assets.</p>
            <p>Also, you can make a carrier! How you may ask? it is easy. In our time, we have a lot of digital asset marketplaces such as <em>NFT</em> marketplaces that you can sell your items and make a carrier. Never underestimate the power open source software provides.</p>
			<h2>Applications</h2>
			<p>There is a vast majority of applications for an <em>AI content generator</em> and you can use it in any way you want. For example, you just enjoy seeing your ideas becoming artistic pieces of work, so this is an application for you.</p>
			<p>Or even if you work in a certain field and you need an <em>artificial assistant</em>, you can count on OpenJourney. This is an example of OpenJourney for interior design: </p>

			<p>See? This is how easy you can turn your ideas to a piece of art that can be used as an sketch, or even better, the proposal for your customers.</p>
            <h2>How to use OpenJourney</h2>
            <p>For using OpenJourney you have to make an account in <a href="https://huggingface.co">huggingface</a> and make a token with <em>write</em> permission. Then, you have to install <em>diffusers</em> and <em>transformers</em> libraries in order to access the model.</p>
            <p>For now, there is no clear instruction about using the model, but we'll provide a step-by-step guide when the model is ready and passed the tests.</p>
